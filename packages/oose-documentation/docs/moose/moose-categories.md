With these areas of concern in place we can now start to talk about how Moose categorises them.
Moose starts from the lowest most general concerns and works it's way up to the higher and more specific.

* Affordance (interaction)
* Layout (interaction)
* Structures & Appliances (application)
* View (application)

## Hierarchy

1. Views - Data fetching and storage
2. Structures, Appliances - Application Logic
3. Layout - Positional Styling
4. Affordances - User Interaction Logic, Aesthetic Styling


Views have a structure
