### Sizing
- `size<SiPrefix>`
  - `sizeGiga` roughly corresponds with traditional `h1` sizing
  - `sizeMega` roughly corresponds with traditional `h2` sizing
  - `sizeKilo` roughly corresponds with traditional `h3` sizing
  - `sizeHecto` roughly corresponds with traditional `h4` sizing
  - `sizeMilli` roughly corresponds with traditional `small` sizing
  
### Margins
`Text-margin` modifiers should only affect the bottom margin. The spacing that might normally be provided by a top margin should instead be provided by a preceding sibling or an ancestor.

- `margin<SiPrefix>`
  - `marginGiga` margins often go well with `sizeGiga`
  - `marginMega` margins often go well with `sizeMega`
  - `marginKilo` margins often go well with `sizeKilo`
  - `margin` margins often go well to space out normal paragraphs

### Weight
- `weightKilo` - Text that appears more important than normal, often bolded.
- `weightMilli` - Text trhat appears less important than normal, often muted.
- `emphasis` - Styled to demonstrate an emphasis on the text.
